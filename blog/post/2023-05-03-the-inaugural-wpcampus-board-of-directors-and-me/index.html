    <p><strong>Heads up!</strong> Yes, friends, this site is (as we said back in the ’90s) under construction. I’ve updated some of the architecture, but I’m going to be “designing in public”.

  </div><p>This is 100% absolutely not new, but I haven’t blogged about this <em>at all</em>, or even updated the site to announce this!</p>
<p>This year, WPCampus moved from one director to a Board of Directors model, allowing Rachel Cherry to step back from being responsible for the whole of the organization. She opened a call for nominations, and while I was interested, my imposter syndrome kicked in (again) and told me not to apply. However, to my surprise, I was nominated by someone else!</p>
<p>In early January, I was voted into the Board, and assumed the officer role of Secretary. It’s an exciting time! It’s been a few months, and I’m settling into my role. <a href="https://www.wpcampus.org/governance/board/">The entire board is an amazing group of people</a>, and I am so honored and proud to be serving with them.</p>
<p>Oh, and as a little plug, join us in <a href="https://2023.wpcampus.org/">New Orleans this July for the 2023 conference</a>! As if I’m not busy enough 😅, I’m also on the planning committee, acting as the attendee and registration coordinator. Tulane University, here we come!</p>
