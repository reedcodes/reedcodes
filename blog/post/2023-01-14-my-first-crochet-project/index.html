  </div><p>I’ve been knitting for over 15 years, but I’d never done any crochet before. Near the end of last year, I had a project that called for provisional cast-on, and one of the methods for doing so is creating a row of knitting from a crochet chain, which would then be unraveled when it came time to put those stitches back on a needle. It was fiddly at first, but I found myself having a lot of fun crocheting that single little chain, and decided that I wanted a project to challenge myself with crochet.</p>
<p>I stopped at <a href="https://loopedyarnworks.com/">Looped</a> over the holiday break to pick up new needles for a project, and asked about a good yarn for creating a simple washcloth for my first crochet project. I came home with one skein of <a href="https://knitrowan.com/en/products/handknit-cotton?taxon_id=875">Rowan Handknit Cotton</a> in Goldfish, a delightfully vibrant and bright orange. Today, after a couple rough starts, I crocheted my first project!</p>
<p>It’s not the world’s most beautiful washcloth, but it’s my first project and I love it. For working on this project, I watched a couple YouTube videos to get the stitches down, and crocheted them in a pattern that looked good to me, and made a lovely square.</p>
<p>For learning how to chain, I followed <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/chain-stitch-crochet-photo-tutorial-979078">Amy Solovay’s walkthrough for crocheting chain stitch</a> on The Spruce Crafts. Each photo is clear and the written steps are quite detailed.</p>
<p>Even though the language spoken in this video is Tamil, I found <a href="https://youtu.be/5u6wyHw3G64">Pushpalatha Raja’s tutorial for basic crochet stitches</a> oh so very helpful! The video itself is understandable (even with not knowing the language), the lighting is good, and she works slowly and repeatedly for each stitch. Her video covers single crochet, double crochet, and triple crochet.</p>
<p>For the washcloth border, I followed <a href="https://youtu.be/gnZC82tg6oM">Blossom Crochet’s tutorial for an easy border</a>. This video goes over how to pick up stitches for the border, single crochet stitch for the first row, and chain and slip stitch for the second row.</p>
<p>So, even though this is my very first project, I’m going to type up the pattern. Maybe this will help someone else with their first project!</p>
