  </div><p>I would like to bring back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>fire up your digital music player</li>
<li>go to “all songs“ and shuffle play <em>everything</em></li>
<li>note the first 10 songs to show up, <em>without</em> skipping anything</li>
<li>create your playlist</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes we would also note our favorite or least favorite songs, bands from the list that we’d seen live, really random connections if a song popped up on someone <em>else’s</em> list, etc. The only things I would ever pass by were podcasts or audio books that may have inadventently made it through the “songs“ group.</p>
<p>My first MP3 player was a <a href="https://www.crutchfield.com/S-X3SfA6toNe4/p_053ZENX40G/Creative-NOMAD-Zen-Xtra.html">40GB Creative Nomad Zen Xtra</a>, and very sadly I no longer have it. I do still have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CgSU9mMOFU5/">my 2005 60GB iPod</a>. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t have <em>everything</em> on it, but it <em>does</em> have nearly 12,000 songs. It’s not as slick as a new iPod or iPhone — when I was on a retreat with folks from one of my groups, the younger ones among us were <em>just amazed</em> that it didn’t have a touch screen — but it’s gotten me through 18 years so far, and recently <a href="https://www.lincolnhighwayjournal.com/">travelled cross-country on my Lincoln Highway road trip</a>. It’s my trusty friend, and it’s staying with me until one of us passes on.</p>
<p>Neither the iPod nor my music folder on the external hard drive has everything I listen to, because over the past few years I’ve used streaming services. First it was Spotify, that I cancelled a while back; now it’s Deezer. I do have a record player and a double-deck cassette player that I’ve hooked up my old stero system. I’ve been trying to get back into buying music, especially physical copies when I can, including CDs but more often than not, cassette tapes and vinyl records. <a href="https://virtua94records.bandcamp.com/music">My brother’s record label, Virtua94</a>, among some other artists I support, releases most of its albums on cassette as well as digital download.</p>
<p><strong>Today’s Friday Random Ten</strong>, brought to you courtesy of that old iPod (is almost 20 years old considered vintage?):</p>
<ol>
<li>“Scrub Club Megamix” – DJ CutterJ, <em>Noncents Vol. 2</em></li>
<li>“Call and Answer” – Barenaked Ladies, <em>Stunt</em></li>
<li>“Moments of Pleasure” – Kate Bush, <em>The Red Shoes</em></li>
<li>“Stagger on Rejoycing” – Global Transmission, <em>Y100’s Philly File</em></li>
<li>“Snowball” – Moby, <em>Hotel: Ambient</em></li>
<li>“Mouth” – Bush, <em>Razorblade Suitcase</em></li>
<li>“South of America” – Phosphorescent, <em>Daytrotter Session: Mar 7, 2008</em></li>
<li>“Let Us Know” – Koufax, <em>Daytrotter Session: Feb 15, 2007</em></li>
<li>“Suck My Wallet” – The Grammar Club, <em>MC Horse Rides Again</em></li>
<li>“Show Me Your Heart” – Need New Body, <em>UFO</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Artists I’ve seen live:</strong> DJ CutterJ, Barenaked Ladies, Moby, The Grammar Club</p>
<p><strong>Favorite track on the list:</strong> I’ve been feeling ’90s nostalgia lately, so I’m gonna go with “Mouth”</p>
<p><strong>Least favorite track on the list:</strong> “Suck My Wallet”, because I think Grammar Club’s first album <em>Bremelanotide</em> was far superior</p>
