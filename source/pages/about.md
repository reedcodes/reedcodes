I am a front-end web developer in Philadelphia PA, specializing in accessible websites using instrinsic design and modern CSS techniques. I’m currently the Director of Web Strategy and Development at Rowan University, and I also serve as the Secretary on the [Board of Directors at WPCampus](https://www.wpcampus.org/governance/board/).

I hold a master’s degree in [Communication, Culture, and Technology](https://cct.georgetown.edu/) from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, focusing on popular media and horror studies. Within my graduate program, I’ve branched out from web development and explored other passions, critically examining horror media with regard to abuse, oppression, identity, and underrepresentation.

My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Science in Digital Media and Web Technology from the [University of Maryland University College](https://www.umgc.edu) (well, now it's Global Campus!), and I also have a professional development certificate in [Information Accessibility Design and Policy from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://iadp.ahs.illinois.edu).

My pronouns are they/them/theirs. My 2005 iPod still gets a lot of use. I’ve travelled a loop around the country via train, and [I drove the entirety of the historic Lincoln Highway](https://lincolnhighwayjournal.com/) in October and November 2022. I knit socks but I also have a bunch of unfinished sweaters. I enjoy tea and coffee equally, and I very much miss singing in a competitive karaoke league.
