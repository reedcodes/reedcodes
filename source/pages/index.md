title: Hello! My name is Reed.
---

<p>I am a senior front-end web developer in Washington DC, specializing in accessible and responsive coding using modern CSS techniques. I hold a master's degree in <a href="https://cct.georgetown.edu/">Communication, Culture, and Technology</a> from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, focusing on popular media and horror studies, and also serve as the Secretary on the <a href="https://www.wpcampus.org/governance/board/">Board of Directors at WPCampus</a>.</p>

<p>My pronouns are they/them/theirs. My 2005 iPod still gets a lot of use. I've travelled a loop around the country via train, and <a href="{{ site.external.lhj | url }}">I drove the entirety of the historic Lincoln Highway</a> in October and November 2022. I knit socks but I also have a bunch of unfinished sweaters. I sing in a competitive karaoke league, and I enjoy tea and coffee equally.</p>

<p>I've been a developer for over twenty years, and I've recently told my imposter syndrome to eff off and I've started <a href="{{ '/talks/' | url }}">speaking at conferences</a>. Within my graduate program, I've branched out from dev and explored other passions, critically examining media with regard to abuse, oppression, and underrepresentation.</p>
