I am a senior front-end web developer in Washington DC, specializing in accessible and responsive coding using modern CSS techniques. I hold a master's degree in [Communication, Culture, and Technology](https://cct.georgetown.edu/) from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, focusing on popular media and horror studies, and also serve as the Secretary on the [Board of Directors at WPCampus](https://www.wpcampus.org/governance/board/).

My pronouns are they/them/theirs. My 2005 iPod still gets a lot of use. I've travelled a loop around the country via train, and [I drove the entirety of the historic Lincoln Highway](https://lincolnhighwayjournal.com/) in October and November 2022. I knit socks but I also have a bunch of unfinished sweaters. I sing in a competitive karaoke league, and I enjoy tea and coffee equally.

I've been a developer for over twenty years, and I've recently told my imposter syndrome to eff off and I've started speaking at conferences. Within my graduate program, I've branched out from dev and explored other passions, critically examining media with regard to abuse, oppression, and underrepresentation.
